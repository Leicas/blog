## Overview

MQTT is a lightweight publish/subscribe communications protocol that uses TCP/IP. It is designed for remote sensors to communicate with controlling devices. The specification is under a royalty-free licence. Interesting features of the protocol include the one-to-many messaging service (publish/subscribe), the Last Will/Testament feature, and the three qualities of service. You can read more about it [here](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-mqtt/index.html).
