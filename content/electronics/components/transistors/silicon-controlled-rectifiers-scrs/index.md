## Overview

A silicon controlled rectifier, or _SCR_, is a form of thyristor, which is it's self a form of transistor. It is argued whether an SCR and thyristor are identical or represent two different devices. Those who believe they are two different devices argue that SCRs are thyristors which have a least four layers of alternating p and n-type silicon[^wikipedia-scrs].

A SCR is made up of 4 alternating layers of P-type and N-type semiconductor.
