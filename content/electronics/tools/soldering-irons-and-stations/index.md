## Overview

* Quick-change tips
* Maximum heating power
* Heating rate (high quality soldering irons can heat-up to the set temperature within about 2 seconds!)
* Stable temperature control under different loads
_
For all but the lightest of work you will want to choose a _soldering station_ instead of a _soldering iron_. The station provides a holder for the iron, keeping it in a safe place while you do other work (so you don't burn yourself!). It also allows to a lighter and higher power iron, as most of the electronics can now be located in the freestanding control unit rather than in the handheld iron.

## Brands

### Hakko

An American company with a vivid and memorable blue/yellow brand color.

### JBC

The creme-de-la-creme of soldering iron brands. JBC makes some of the highest-quality soldering stations, but as expected, this comes at a very high price.

### Weller

The Weller brand is associated with quality, second only to JBC. Naturally, their products are generally cheaper than JBCs to compensate.
