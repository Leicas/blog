## Overview

The cross-product is a mathematical operation you can perform on two vectors in 3D space. The cross-product produces a vector which is orthogonal to both of the input vectors, which means it is also normal to the plane containing the two input vectors.

## Mathematical Symbol

The cross product of vectors `\(\textbf{a}\)` and `\(\textbf{b}\)` is written as:

<div>$$ \textbf{a} \times \textbf{b} $$</div>

## Defining Equation

The cross product is defined by the formula:

<div>$$ \textbf{a} \times \textbf{b} = ||\textbf{a}|| ||\textbf{b}|| \, sin (\theta) \, \textbf{n} $$</div>

## Cross Product Properties

The cross product of two vector always produces a vector which:

* Is orthogonal to both input vectors (i.e. normal to the plane containing the input vectors)
* Has a direction which is determined by the right-hand rule
* Has a magnitude which is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the two input vectors.
