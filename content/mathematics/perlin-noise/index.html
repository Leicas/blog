<p>Ken Perlin invented the Perlin noise algorithm following CGI work on the movie Tron.</p>

<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Reputeless/PerlinNoise">siv::PerlinNoise</a> is a good header-only Perlin noise library for C++.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/noise/">Python library noise</a> has Perlin "improved" noise and Perlin simplex noise algorithms.</p>
