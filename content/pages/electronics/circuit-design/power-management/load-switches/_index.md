Some load-switches have reverse-polarity protection. More information of how they exactly implement reverse-protection with only the one MOSFETÂ can be found in the [The Substrate (Body) Connection section of the MOSFET page](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/mosfets#the-substrate-body-connection).

Note the switches connected to the MOSFET substrate which show how reverse-current protection is performed."  >}}
