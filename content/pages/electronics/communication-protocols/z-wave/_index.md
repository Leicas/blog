# Overview

Z-Wave is a wireless communications protocol primarily designed for home automation.

# Frequency

Z-Wave operates on frequencies around 900MHz. The exact frequency depends on country.

# Network Topology

Z-Wave uses a source-routed mesh network topology. The mesh network allows devices to send messages through other Z-Wave devices before reaching the destination, allowing the message to "hop" between devices to extend the communication range and overcome RF dead spots.
