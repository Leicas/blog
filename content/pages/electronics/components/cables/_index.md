# Standards

## NEC

The _National Electrical Code_ (NEC) is an American standards body which defines a set of standards for certain types of cabling and how they should be installed and used.

NEC _types_ are acronyms consisting of a prefix describing **cable type** (e.g. coax, CATV, fiber optic) and a suffix indicating the type of **flame test** it has passed and where it can be **installed**.

# Computer Cable

## Overview

Computer cable can also be called "Security" or "Alarm" cable.

## AWM

Underwriters Laboratories categorises some computer cable as _appliance wiring material_ (AWM). It has become an **industry standard**. There are 5 different style numbers.

AWM cable is designed for the internal wiring of factory-assembled, "listed" appliances such as computers, whitewear, and industrial equipment.

## UL2464

UL2464 is a loose standard defining some of the properties of computer cable, maintained by Underwriters Laboratories.
