# Overview

The DIAC is a form of diode which conducts current only after it reaches it's breakover voltage. The diode then continues to conduct, even if the voltage reduces, until the point where current drops below it's holding current, at which point the DIAC goes back to it's initial non-conductingÂ state.

# Schematic Symbol

Below is the schematic symbol for the DIAC.
