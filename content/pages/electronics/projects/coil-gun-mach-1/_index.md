Project Start Date: April 2006
Project End Date: July 2006
Current State: Completed

This is my first attempt at a coil gun.

Switch: 2x 600V 3300A (non-repitive pulse) SCR
Capacitor Bank: 24x 330V 80uF Capacitors
Total Energy: 209.1J
Target Efficiency: 3% (6.27J of kinetic energy) Projectile: Steel rod 30mm long, and tipped Projectile Mass: 15g Target Velocity: 28.9m/s (104km/h)


## Capacitor Bank


The capacitor bank was built from capacitors scrounged from used disposable flash camera's. I got the cameras for free from a Kodak photo processing store just by asking nicely :-). Each camera has one 330V electrolytic capacitor ranging from 80 to 120uF. These can easily be unsoldered and hooked together for an el-cheapo capacitor bank.

## The Coil


Wire Diameter = 1.00mm (18AWG)
Coil Resistance = 0.3Ohm
Coil Inside Diameter = 12.5mm
Coil Outside Diameter = 30.0mm
Coil Length = 30mm

The coil was made with enamelled copper wire and wrapped around a coil former. Two slotted metal sides contain the wire and provide some structural strength. The coil was covered in two-part epoxy to hold the wire in place. The coil is designed to be slipped onto the projectile tube.
