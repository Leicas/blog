# The Boiler


Added a weldless bi-metal thermometer. This was brought from MashMaster ([http://mashmaster.com.au](http://mashmaster.com.au/)). It cost NZ$57 and about NZ$2o to ship it to New Zealand from Australia. The exact thermometer can be found on [this webpage](http://mashmaster.com.au/p/923730/weldless-bi-metal-thermometer-3-dial-face--short-thread---for-pots-and-kegs.html).


# RCD


A residual-current device (RCD) is a very good piece of cheap safety equipment to use with any mains-powered brewing equipment. It detects differences between the current going out and the current coming back in. If there is any significant difference, it shuts of the power. RCD's prevent large and potentially lethal electrical shocks if there happens to be a fault with the electrical equipment, which can be common in a wet environment such as when brewing.

The following picture shows an RCD and the best way to loop a cable so that water cannot run down it's length and soak into the plug contacts.
