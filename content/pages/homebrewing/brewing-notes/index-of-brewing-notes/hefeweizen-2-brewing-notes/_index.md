Brew Start Date: 25/09/11




Brew End Date: n/a

Notes: This is the second all-grain wheat beer we've tried, after the first one ([Hefeweizen 1](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/homebrewing/brewing-notes/hefe-weizen-brewing-notes)) sadly got infected.


# Ingredients


Malt



	  * 5kg Wheat
	  * 1kg Weyermann Pilsner
	  * 1kg Vienna



## Hops





	  * 40g Hallertau (see Boil section for add times)



## Yeast








	  * Safbrew Wheat Yeast WB-06






## Other





	  * 1kg Liquid Honey



# Mashing

**Notes:**

The mash temperature was a little higher than hoped. Due to the large amount of grain requiring a great deal of water, and the strike temperature being a little to high (it would of been perfect for slightly less gain).

**Notes:**

Thankfully, this time around, the kettle filter didn't get as clogged as much as last time a Wheat beer was run though it (see the [Hefeweizen Brewing Notes](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/homebrewing/brewing-notes/hefe-weizen-brewing-notes)). This is possibly due to the runnier honey we used (previously we had suspicions that the faster cooling rate due to the new immersion cooler was causing more particles to fall out of suspension).

**Notes:**

Beer was kept on a temperature-controlled heater pad. Beer developed a gross taste after a few days, and after the end of the week, tasted horrible. Best guess is that is has got infected (again, much like the previous Hefeweizen).
