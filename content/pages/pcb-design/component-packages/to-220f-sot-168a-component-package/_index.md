# A TO-220 Package With An Insulated Body

One of a disadvantages of the TO-220AB package is that the metal tab, although great for heatsinking reasons, is connected to the middle pin of the component.

The TO-220F is a variant of the TO-220 package which has an **insulated metal tab, which is not electrically connected to any of its pins**. Some thermal performance is sacrificed because of this insulating layer.
