# Comments




Large panel mount package used for high-power SCR's. Has good heat-sinking capabilities. Thread is 28.5mm in diameter, so fits 29-30mm hole. The metal case/thread is usually used as the anode, and the thick cable the cathode (there normally is a flying lead for the cathode also), along with a white flying lead for the gate.
