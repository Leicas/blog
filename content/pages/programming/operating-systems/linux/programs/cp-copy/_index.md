# Overview




If you want to move or rename files (instead of copying), please checkout the [mv command](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/programming/operating-systems/linux/programs/mv-move).




# Copying A Single File




This is the simplist cp procedure:




cp ~/original_file.txt ~/copied_file.txt




# Coping Multiple, Specific Files To A Directory




This can be done with the syntax:



    
    cp ~/{file1,file2,file3,file4} ~/destination_folder/




Note that there must be no spaces between the comma-separated files.
