XAMPP is a great tool for running a "website" server on your local computer. It can run things like php scripts and handle MySQL requests, before serving the HTML to your browser.

It is a great tool for developing and testing websites before putting them online.

XAMPP has a control panel which allows you to switch on/off it's various features.
