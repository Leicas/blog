This page contains a number of videos I have recordered related to pyrotechnics. Included are videos of black powder tests, rocketry, fireball creation, and general pyrotechnics (anything from mortar firing to videos of the tools used for pyrotechnics). All videos are hosted on my YouTube account (evilgecko007). I recommend turning up your speakers (especially the bass), and making the videos full-screen before watching.
