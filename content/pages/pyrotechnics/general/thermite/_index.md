Making thermite with self-ground Aluminium is hard to get working. I've tried this many times with Aluminium made by grinding Aluminium window framing with either a file or an angle grinder and a cardboard power catcher. I think the problem is that the oxide layer forms at makes it really hard for the Aluminium to react with anything. This is opposed to brought Aluminium powder, which is treated with something to stop the oxide forming (maybe oil?).
