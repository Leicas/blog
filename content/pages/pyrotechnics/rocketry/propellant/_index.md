# KNDX


KNDX stands for potassium nitrate-dextrose, and is a easy-to-make rocket propellant that is popular with hobbyist rocketry. The most common ratio is 60% potassium nitrate, 40% dexrtose (by weight).


## Melting


Not melted.

## The End Result


The propellant grains in this image have been made rather poorly, notice the cracks and uneven surface!
