Rocket motors are the part of the rocket which provides the thrust.


# Anchors


Anchors help prevent the nozzle and end-plug from coming out during the burn.

# Thermal Sleeves


Thermal sleeves help prevent the rocket motor casing from rupturing during the burn due to heat. This is especially true for PVC rocket motors.

You can view the motors I made for either rockets, experiments, or even the odd skatebaord on the [Rocket Projects page](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/pyrotechnics/rocketry/projects).
