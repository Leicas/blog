# SGP4

Simplified General Perturbations 4 (SGP4) is a mathematical model used to **calculate the position** of a satellite(s) relative to an Earth-centered co-ordinate system.

When given a two-line element (TLE) that describes the current position of a staellite, SGP4 can be used to calculate the future position of the satellite (this is called _propagation_).

SGP4 is a term commonly used to refer to **both SGP4 (near satellite) and SDP4** (far satellite) models.
