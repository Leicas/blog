Testing out YouTube posts...

A nice tune from Bingo Players, released in April this year. With 'discoey' vocals and backing, it sounds like it came from the 90's (I thought it did for months, until it appeared on a new Ministry album...). Maybe it's because of the soul genre sample they use from "Piano In The Dark" by Brenda Russell.
