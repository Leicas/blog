Benny Benassi is arriving back on the scene, and for once it doesn't follow the formula "Take some new vocals, add the Satisfaction bass line and repeat monthly". His first new one was released with Chris Brown earlier this year (Beautiful People), and Cinema chases it up nicely. Currently a war is raging out between loyal fans of this original and the Skrillex remix. Just try and make sense of the video?!?
