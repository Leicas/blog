For the last few weeks, this sites been offline due to malware causing excessive CPU usage and the account being suspended by JustHost for breaching the 10% CPU policy (10% of the CPU that runs the shared server). It turns out there were was malware found in the Twenty11 Wordpress theme files. I have no idea how it got there, since Twenty11 is a well used and trusted theme, so I can only guess it infected these files from an outside source.

Sorry for the inconvenience!
