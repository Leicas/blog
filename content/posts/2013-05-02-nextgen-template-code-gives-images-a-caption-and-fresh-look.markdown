After playing around with the NextGen plugin PHP files and this sites CSS style file, I have created what NextGEN calls a "template" for a single picture (in NextGEN lingo, a singlepic), which adds a border and the caption to the image. Which by-the-way, is a feature that NextGEN lacks, and should implement themselves!

Here is what images look like now, with the custom template applied.

[singlepic id=1125 w=500 h=300 float=center]

Which, IMO, is a big improvement over what they used to be. They now have a nice, semi-transparent border, and include a caption below the image (which is associated with the image in the NextGEN gallery page). This is what they used to look like:

[singlepic id=1126 w=500 h=300 float=center]

But...it's not perfect...yet. As you can see below, in certain situations the images to go crazy.

[singlepic id=1124 w=650 h=500 float=center]

I am no full-time website designer. Playing with HTML objects like div's Â and getting the right float setting, width, height, margin, alignment e.t.c can be a guestimate at the best of times. I will hopefully work out how to fix this sometime soon...

Note that this custom template has been disabled for the images in this post, otherwise you'd get the mirror-in-a-mirror look which would be utterly confusing.
