It's update time! Here is a list of some of most important updates that have happened on this site in the last month or so...



	  1. New image format for the [Component Package page](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/circuit-design/component-packages) images! For each component package, I have begun to use an individual slideshow for the associated images. This looks way better than the existing way of just posting the associated images one-by-one down the page.

	  2. There has been new packages added to the [Component Package page](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/circuit-design/component-packages), including [TO-Leadless](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/circuit-design/component-packages#to-leadless), [LGA](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/circuit-design/component-packages#lga), and [SIM cards (including all variants)](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/circuit-design/component-packages#sim-cards).

	  3. There has been heaps updates to [Altium-Script-Central](https://github.com/gbmhunter/Altium-Script-Central), a GitHub repo which contains useful scripts when designing PCBs in Altium.
	  4. Updates to the [Connectors page](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/connectors), including the new sections [Headers](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/connectors#headers) and [Circular Connectors](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/connectors#circular-connectors).
{{< figure src="/images/misc/headers-on-connectors-page-screenshot.jpg" caption="The Connectors page has been updated with the new sections 'Headers' and 'Circular Connectors'." caption-position="bottom" width="500px" >}}
	  5. The is a new page on [Memory](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/memory) under Components.
	  6. There are new pages under Web Design on [node.js](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/programming/website-design/nodejs) (or just called node) and [JSON](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/programming/website-design/json).
	  7. There is a new calculator on the [Resistors page](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/resistors), called the [Standard Resistance Calculator](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/resistors#standard-values). You pass it any resistance, and it will find the closest standard resistance according the series you specify (e.g. E12, E48 series).

	  8. There is a new [Satellite Modem page](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/satellite-modems), [Cellular Modem page](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/cellular-modems) and an [HE910 Design Notes page](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/cellular-modems/he910-design-notes).
	  9. I have added the SEO Smart Links plugin, which automatically creates internal links on pages and posts based on certain keywords. This is really useful, as it means I can stop doing it manually!
