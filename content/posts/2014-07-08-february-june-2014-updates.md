So progress has been a little slower than usual lately, here are all the updates from Feburary 2014 to June 2014:






	  * New info on jumpers (jumpers in resistor packages) on the Resistors page
	  * New page on [electropermanent magnets](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/electropermanent-magnets-epms) (cool electronic magnets which retain their magnetic state after powerdown.
	  * New force equation on the Capacitors page (related to the force exerted on the plates due to the electric charge)
	  * Picture added of card-edge connector gold fingers on the connectors page
	  * New component packages added to the popular [Component Package page](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/circuit-design/component-packages).
	  * New page on [electrical comparators](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/comparators).
	  * 
		

I am now using Latex to draw diagrams! I have begun using [QuickLatex](http://quicklatex.com/), [TikZ](http://www.texample.net/tikz/) and [Circuitikz](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/circuitikz). This allows me to draw images like this:

Admittedly, this is just an image, but the real diagrams on the [Op-Amp page](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/electronics/components/op-amps) are described in the Tex language, and only rendered when you visit the page!


	
	  * And on a similar note, there is now both a [TikZ and PGF tutorial](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/programming/languages/tex/tikz-and-pgf-tutorial) and a [CircuitikZ tutorial](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/programming/languages/tex/drawing-schematics-with-tikz-and-circuitikz).
