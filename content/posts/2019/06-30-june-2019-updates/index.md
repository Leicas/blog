* The page on {{% link text="Electronic Noise" src="/electronics/circuit-design/noise" %}} moved from Electronics->Test And Measurement to Electronics->Circuit Design.

* Renamed the Fast Fourier Transform page to the {{% link text="Fourier Transform page" src="/programming/signal-processing/fourier-transforms" %}}, as it now contains information about other Fourier transforms.

* Added graphs of 1D Fourier transformations:

    {{% figure src="/programming/signal-processing/fourier-transforms/1d-fourier-transform.png" %}}

    and animated .gif's of 2D Fourier transformations:

    {{% figure src="/programming/signal-processing/fourier-transforms/sinusoidal.gif" %}}

* Updated the pytest page with info on `mark` (markers) and `pytest` naming conventions.

* Removed the `updates` directory that all monthly update posts were under.

* Added a {{% link text="tutorial on pandas" src="/programming/languages/python/pandas" %}}, a popular data analytics library for Python.

    {{% img src="pandas_logo.png" width="700px" caption="The pandas logo." %}}

* Updated the {{% link text="Python Debugging page" src="/programming/languages/python/python-debugging" %}} with more info on `pdb`.

* Updated the {{% link text="Passive Filters page" src="/electronics/circuit-design/filters/passive-filters" %}} with more information on low-pass RC filters, including plots of the frequency response:
