* Updated the {{% link src="/programming/operating-systems/linux/programs/mv-move" text="mv (move) page" %}} with information on using extended bash glob extensions to provide exclusion patterns.

* The {{% link text="Introduction To Rotation Matrices page" src="/mathematics/geometry/rotation-matrices" %}} has been updated with tutorials/example on how to combine rotation matrices and how to calculate the rotation matrix to describe the rotation between two reference frames, as well as a section on how to convert RPY (roll-pitch-yaw, or _Euler angles_) to rotation matrices.

* Added an interactive 3D rotation visualizer, which shows you how a right-hand coordinate system XYZ is rotated in 3D space by either a rotation matrix, quaternion, or angle-axis rotation. This tool is also very useful to convert between the three ways of describing a rotation (when you enter a rotation in one notation, the other two get updated automatically).
