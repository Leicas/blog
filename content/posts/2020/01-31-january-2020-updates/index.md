* Added the {{% link text="Happy New Year 2020 page" src="" %}}, which compiles interesting blog statistics for the 2019 year.

* Renamed all leaf nodes filenames from `_index.md` to `index.md`, as using the former led to the tag pages not being created.

* Information on handling warnings has been added to the {{% link text="Numpy page" src="" %}}.

* Updated the {{% link text="TSOC-6 Component Package page" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/tsoc-component-package" %}} with more clarification on the differences between the different variants (D6+1, D6-1, D6N+1 and D6N-1).
