## RPC Metadata

The command-line tool `gdalinfo` will print the RPC metadata if present.

## Always Make Sure To dataset=None

Until a `dataset` object is set to `None` in Python, you cannot guarantee that all of the data has been written to the file system.

```python
ds = gdal.Open('image.tif')

## Do stuff here...

## Make sure to set the dataset to None, this will make sure all data
# is written out of buffers into file
ds = None
```

## Converting x, y Pixel Coordinates To Lat/Lons Using RPCs

RPC metadata can be embedded within an non-orthorectified image file. GDAL can use this RPC metadata to convert (or transform) co-ordinates in x, y pixels space into latitude/longitudes (and also to perform the reverse, to calculate x/y pixel co-ordinates from lat/lons).

You can do this in GDAL with a `Transformer` and the `TransformPoints()` function. However, these are quite poorly documented online (the benefit of `TransformPoints()` over `TransformPoint` is that you can do many points at once, making things more efficient).

```python
ds = gdal.Open('image_with_rpc_metadata.tif')

tr = gdal.Transformer(ds, None, ['METHOD=RPC'])

## TransformPoints requires the points to be in the same array, in the form:
# [ [x0, y0], [x1, y1], ... ]
xy_points = np.array([[0, 0], [5, 10], [10, 20]])
transformed_points, shape = tr.TransformPoints(0, xy_points)

# tranformed_points will be a list of tuples, in the form:
# [ (lon0, lat0, height0), (lon1, lat1, height1), ... ]
# where (lon0, lat0, height0) maps to (x0, y0)
```
