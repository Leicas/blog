Recently got a batch of Hefeweizen (cloudy wheat) beer underway. Being true to the homebrewing culture, this was an all-grain batch with a good 7kg's of wheat and a kg of sugar, adding a decent amount of fermentables which should push the alcohol percentage into the 6-7% range!

The brewing notes can be found [here](http://blog.mbedded.ninja/homebrewing/brewing-notes/hefe-weizen-brewing-notes).
