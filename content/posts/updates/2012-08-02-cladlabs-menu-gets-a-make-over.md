It's been on the back of my mind to fix up the ugly main menu for some time now. I have been using a 'Mega Menu' plugin, which allows the cool drop-down features that you see on this site. However, the default colours themes that came with the menu don't fit nicely with the transparency-themed colour-scheme of this site. With a bit of CSS tweaking and a few hours, the menu now looks nice!
