I installed the Wordpress Jetpack plugin just over a year ago, and with it came the Â site statistics page, which gives you a nice overview of how many visitors visit your site. It has been interesting seeing the growth over the last year.

The above image shows visitor growth per month on blog.mbedded.ninja over the last year (from May 2012 to May 2013). May 2012 has around 300 visitors, while May 2013 has just over 6,000!
