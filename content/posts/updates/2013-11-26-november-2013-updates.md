It's been a buuuussssyyyyyy month around here. A list of the updates for this month:

* [candy-calc firmware project](https://github.com/gbmhunter/candy-calc) started on GitHub. I am hoping to eventually convert [all calculators on this site](/electronics/general/online-calculators) to use this framework.

* LT3745 Design Guide page (**as of Dec 2017, URL not available**) and calculator using the [candy-calc](https://github.com/gbmhunter/candy-calc) framework

* New [1-wire Communications Protocol page](/electronics/circuit-design/communication-protocols/1-wire-protocol)

* Installed the [SEO Smart Links plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-automatic-links/), which links pages to others based on scanned text

* Information added about [digital temperature sensors ](/electronics/components/temperature-sensors#digital-sensors)added to the[ Temperature Sensors page](/electronics/components/temperature-sensors).

* [rsync](/programming/operating-systems/linux/rsync) and [ddclient](/programming/operating-systems/linux/ddclient) pages in the [Linux page](/programming/operating-systems/linux)

* Info on [LED lens types](/electronics/components/leds#lens-shapes) on the [LED page](/electronics/components/leds)

	{{< figure src="/images/misc/led-lens-shapes-screenshot.jpg" caption="Info on LED lens shapes has been added to the LED page." >}}[](/electronics/components/leds)

* More info added to the [Windows](/programming/operating-systems/windows) and [Batch file](/programming/languages/batch-files) pages

* A new [Impedance Controlled Routing page](/electronics/circuit-design/impedance-controlled-routing)

* New info on the [Cellular Modem page](/electronics/components/cellular-modems), and a [Telit HE910 Design Notes page](/electronics/components/cellular-modems/he910-design-notes)

* New page on [Antenna Design](/electronics/circuit-design/antenna-design), incorporating the use of [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/)

	{{< figure src="/images/misc/antenna-page-screenshot.jpg" caption="A screenshot of the Antenna page." >}}[](https://developers.google.com/chart/)

* New page on the [TI C2000 MCU architecture](/programming/cpu-architectures/c2000)

As always, enjoy!
