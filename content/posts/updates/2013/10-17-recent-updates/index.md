It's update time! Here is a list of some of most important updates that have happened on this site in the last month or so...

1. New image format for the [Component Package page](/pcb-design/component-packages/) images! For each component package, I have begun to use an individual slideshow for the associated images. This looks way better than the existing way of just posting the associated images one-by-one down the page.

2. There has been new packages added to the [Component Package page](/pcb-design/component-packages/), including [TO-Leadless](/pcb-design/component-packages/to-leadless-component-package/), [LGA](/pcb-design/component-packages/lga-component-package/), and [SIM cards (including all variants)](/pcb-design/component-packages/sim-card-sizes/).

3. There has been heaps updates to [Altium-Script-Central](https://github.com/gbmhunter/Altium-Script-Central), a GitHub repo which contains useful scripts when designing PCBs in Altium.

4. Updates to the [Connectors page](/electronics/components/connectors), including the new sections [Headers](/electronics/components/connectors/headers/) and [Circular Connectors](/electronics/components/connectors#circular-connectors).

	{{< figure src="/images/misc/headers-on-connectors-page-screenshot.jpg" caption="The Connectors page has been updated with the new sections 'Headers' and 'Circular Connectors'."  width="500px" >}}

5. The is a new page on [Memory](/electronics/components/memory) under Components.

6. There are new pages under Web Design on [node.js](/programming/website-design/nodejs) (or just called node) and [JSON](/programming/serialization-formats/jason/).

7. There is a new calculator on the [Resistors page](/electronics/components/resistors), called the [Standard Resistance Calculator](/electronics/components/resistors/#the-e-series). You pass it any resistance, and it will find the closest standard resistance according the series you specify (e.g. E12, E48 series).

8. There is a new [Satellite Modem page](/electronics/components/satellite-modems), [Cellular Modem page](/electronics/components/cellular-modems) and an [HE910 Design Notes page](/electronics/components/cellular-modems/he910-design-notes).

9. I have added the SEO Smart Links plugin, which automatically creates internal links on pages and posts based on certain keywords. This is really useful, as it means I can stop doing it manually!
