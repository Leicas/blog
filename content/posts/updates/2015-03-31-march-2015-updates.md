* The biggest update for March was the switch from a Linux/CPanel shared server to a managed Wordpress service, and the theme change to Avada! See the [Move To Managed Wordpress Hosting For Speed Increase post](/site-admin/move-to-managed-wordpress-hosting-for-speed-increase) for more info.
* A heap load of information added to the [USB Protocol page](/electronics/communication-protocols/usb-protocol).This includes oscilloscope images of surge currents on the VBUS trace. Added the child page [Chargers](/electronics/communication-protocols/usb-protocol/chargers).
* Information on the body connection inside MOSFETs added to the [MOSFET page](/electronics/components/transistors/mosfets/).
* New page on [Made For Apple (MFi)](/electronics/circuit-design/made-for-ipod-iphone-ipad-mfi).

* New [WLCSP package](/pcb-design/component-packages/wlcsp-component-package) added to the Component Package database.

* Added [Civil Footnotes plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/civil-footnotes/) for adding footnotes to posts/pages.
* Moved the info on buck converters from the [Power Regulators page](/electronics/components/power-regulators) onto it's own [Buck Converters page](/electronics/components/power-regulators/buck-converters).
* Moved the info on SEPIC converters from the [Power Regulators page](/electronics/components/power-regulators) onto it's own [SEPIC Converters page](/electronics/components/power-regulators/sepic-converters).
* Moved the [Load Switches page](/electronics/circuit-design/power-management/load-switches) so that it is a child of [Power Management](/electronics/circuit-design/power-management).

* New page on [Analogue Switches](/electronics/components/analogue-switches).
* Information added about ESD Diodes On CMOS I/O to the ESD Protection page.
* [SOT-1226](/pcb-design/component-packages/sot-1226-component-package) added to the [Component Package Database](/pcb-design/component-packages).
