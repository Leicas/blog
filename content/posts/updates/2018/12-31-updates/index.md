* Site was migrated from Wordpress to Hugo! See [/posts/updates/2018/12-15-site-migration-to-hugo-complete](/posts/updates/2018/12-15-site-migration-to-hugo-complete) for more info.

* A new [Python Dictionaries page](/pages/programming/languages/python/python-dictionaries.md) created.
* New [Hugo page](/pages/programming/website-design/static-website-generators/hugo) created.
* New [OpenMP Tutorial](content/pages/programming/languages/c-plus-plus/openmp-tutorial.md).
* Many improvements to the [Linux Serial Ports Using C/C++ page](/programming/operating-systems/linux/linux-serial-ports-using-c-cpp.md).
* Added numbering to page headings (`h2`, `h3`, `h4`, ...).
* Site is now mobile friendly! I learnt a bit on responsive web design over the Christmas break and updated the HTML/CSS of this site so it looks good on mobile devices.
