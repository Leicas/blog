* New [Domain Name Servers (DNS) page](/programming/website-design/domain-name-servers-dns).

* New review on different serialization formats (e.g. CSV, JSON, TOML, XML, YAML). This can be found at the [A Comparison Of Serialization Formats page](/programming/serialization-formats/a-comparison-of-serialization-formats).

* NinjaCalc was moved from paid GoDaddy shared Linux hosting to my free Netlify hosting. Not only does this make the build/deploy step much easier (Netlify automatically builds and deploys when changes are pushed to `master`), but it also saves me money! After this blog was converted from Wordpress to Hugo and also moved to Netlify a few months ago (see the [Site Migration To Hugo Complete post](/posts/updates/2018/12-15-site-migration-to-hugo-complete/) for more info), I no longer have any need for the GoDaddy server, saving approx. US$150 per year!
