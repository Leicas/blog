* All image duplicates in `static/images/` were deleted. These duplicates were created back when the site was running on Wordpress due to it's image optimization straegies (creating a _pyramid_ of resolutions for the same image to best match the size of the image when it is rendered on a page).
* Addition of a `link-rel` shortcode.
Updates to many of the component package pages.
