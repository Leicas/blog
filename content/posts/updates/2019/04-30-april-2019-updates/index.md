* All image duplicates in `static/images/` were deleted. These duplicates were created back when the site was running on Wordpress due to it's image optimization strategies (creating a _pyramid_ of resolutions for the same image to best match the size of the image when it is rendered on a page).

* Addition of a `link-rel` shortcode.

* Updates to many of the component package pages in the {{% link text="Component Package Database" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/_index.md" %}}.

* Addition of the {{% link text="TO-273AA Component Package page" src="/pcb-design/component-packages/to-273aa-component-package/index.md" %}}.

    {{% img src="to-273aa-super-to-220-component-package-3d-render.png" width="200px" %}}

* Updates to the {{% link text="Convolution page" src="/programming/signal-processing/convolution/index.md" %}}, including the addition of a worked example showing the calculation of the convolution between two "box-car" signals.
