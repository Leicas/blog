* The {{% link text="Component Designators page" src="/electronics/circuit-design/component-designators/index.md" %}} was updated. The mobile unfriendly one-big-table design was removed in favour of separate sections for each component and designator/schematic symbol. Some of the symbols were also updated using InkScape.

* The PCB Design Tools section of the main PCB Design page was moved onto it's own {{% link text="PCB Design Tools page" src="/pcb-design/pcb-design-tools/_index.md" %}}.

* All section on the main PCB Design page regarding PCB layers were moved into their own new {{% link text="PCB Layers page" src="/pcb-design/pcb-layers/_index.md" %}}.

* Big updates to the {{% link text="Convolution page" src="/programming/signal-processing/convolution/index.md" %}}, including the addition of a worked example where the convolution of two box-car functions is calculated.

    {{% img src="convolution-two-box-car-functions.gif" width="500px" caption="An animated .gif showing the convolution of two box-car functions. The value of the convolution function at any time t (bottom line in red) is the amount area shown in red in the middle plot, which is the area under the curve of f(t)g(t) (the two waveforms multiplied together)." %}}
