* The {{% link text="Component Designators page" src="/electronics/circuit-design/component-designators/index.md" %}} was updated. The mobile unfriendly one-big-table design was removed in favour of separate sections for each component and designator/schematic symbol. Some of the symbols were also updated using InkScape.

* The PCB Design Tools section of the main PCB Design page was moved onto it's own {{% link text="PCB Design Tools page" src="/pcb-design/pcb-design-tools/_index.md" %}}.

* All section on the main PCB Design page regarding PCB layers were moved into their own new {{% link text="PCB Layers page" src="/pcb-design/pcb-layers/_index.md" %}}.
