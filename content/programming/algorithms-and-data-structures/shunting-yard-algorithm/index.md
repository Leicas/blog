As humans, we are used to using infix notation to write mathematic expressions:

$$ y = 5 * (x+2)^2 $$

Unfortunately, this notation is very hard for a computer to understand and parse.

RPN can linearize a tree data-structure, which can have memory benefits.

The Hewlett-Packard HP-48 graphic calculator presented RPN to the user (no infix notation was allowed!).

For a detailed code-based walk-through of an AST expression parser in C#, see [https://mariusbancila.ro/blog/2009/02/03/evaluating-expressions-part-1/](https://mariusbancila.ro/blog/2009/02/03/evaluating-expressions-part-1/).
