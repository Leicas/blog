The C2000 has a math-optimised core and is designed for high-performance real-time operations.

## The Size Of A Byte

_**TLDR: The size of a byte on the C2000 is 16 bits.**_

The C2000 is somewhat unusual in that the smallest addressable memory unit is 16-bits. The C standard specifies that `sizeof` must return the number of bytes required to store an object, and it also stipulates that size(char) must equal 1. Because chars are stored in 16 byte memory locations (to make them separately addressable), this means that the size of a byte on the C2000 architecture is 16 bits!
