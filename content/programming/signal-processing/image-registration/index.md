## Overview

# Cross-Correlation

## Mutual Information

_Mutual information_ quantifies the information shared between two different images. It is different to cross-correlation in that the relationship between the two images does not have to be linear.

## Modalities

Image correlation becomes more difficult when the images have different modalities. A modality is a particular technique used to perform imaging. A typical example of image registraion between images of different moldalities occurs in the medical domain with MR (magnetic resonanace) and US (ultrasound) images.

Aims to extract structural content in the local region which is which can be seen in other modalities.
