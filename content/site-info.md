# Latex

Display-style math equations should be surrounded with:

```html
<div>$$ equation goes here $$</div>
```

Inline-style math equations that are in markdown code should be surrounded with (note the backticks):

```html
`\( equation goes here \)`
```

or, if the inline equations are inside an HTML element, that backticks can be removed:

```html
<p>\( equation goes here \)</p>
```
