## Site History

This blog started of called "Kaboom Pyrotechnics". And yup, you guessed it, it solely contained information on how to make fireworks. It was intially designed in [Microsoft Front Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage) and then in [Dreamweaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver). These were both WYSIWYG editors!

## Latex

Display-style math equations should be surrounded with:

```html
<div>$$ equation goes here $$</div>
```

Inline-style math equations that are in markdown code should be surrounded with (note the backticks):

```html
`\( equation goes here \)`
```

or, if the inline equations are inside an HTML element, that backticks can be removed:

```html
<p>\( equation goes here \)</p>
```

## HTML Elements

Use the &lt;del&gt; tag for most text which requires a strike-through.

Use the class <code>centered</code> on block elements to center text within it.
