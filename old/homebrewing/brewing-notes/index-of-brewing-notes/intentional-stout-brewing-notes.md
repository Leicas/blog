**Notes:**

Mash temperature was quite low, which resulted in the beer being quite dry. Used about the maximum amount of grain (8kg) that could fit in the chilli-bin mash tun.

**Notes:**

Wort frothed up at the start of the boil and briefly overflowed over the sides of the keg. This calmed down after a few minutes once the hops were added. Berries were added in a permeable bag that was removed after the boil had finished. Chocolate was roughly crushed before adding. Had difficulties draining the green beer from the kettle after the boil had finished due to the amount of solids (hops and other stuff, probably berry bits). In the end the filter had to be removed and the beer poured into the fermenter, resulting in plenty of hops going with it.

**Notes:**

Primary fermentation was racked after a week because we wanted to get rid of the large layer of hop sediment due to the beer not being filtered when poured into the fermenter. We were worried that if we had left it any longer the hops would have adversely affected the taste.

**Notes:**

First time that we have filtered a beer. Used a small 12V non-immersable propeller pump with an adjustable voltage supply to control the flow rate. Bottled into 750mL crate bottles.

Found gunk on the inside of the plastic fermenter tap! We got rid of it before we began brewing. See the photos for more info…

After the third day, I had a taste, and no bad flavours for once! Exciting news, it probably means we have found the cause of the infection. The taste and smell after a week will be the true test though.

Two weeks later, the beer still tasted fine!
